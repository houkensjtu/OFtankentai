- Definition of turbulence is a very challenging issue due to its extremely complex nature and incomplete understanding of its theory. 
- Turbulence. Does it matter?
    - Usually the existence of turbulence enhances heat transfer, and lower the flow resistance (because the existence of many small vortexes in the flow region).
